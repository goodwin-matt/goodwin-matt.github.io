I currently work at Oracle Data Cloud as a Data Scientist working on problems in the digitial advertising industry. Previous to the ODC, I did a brief internship at Duke University in the Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroengineering analyzing electrical signals from mice brains to help the lab better understand mental health disorders.

I got my graduate degree in statistics and my undergraduate in applied math, both from BYU.

I love all things outdoors, especially backpacking in the mountain west, and reading books on historic figures.

Above all I love spending time with my family - especially hiking with my family and telling them about historic figures I am reading about.

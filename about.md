I am a data scientist currently working at Oracle Data Cloud, a branch of Oracle that focuses on problems in the digitial advertising industry. Previous to the ODC, I did a brief internship at Duke University in the [Laboratory of Psychiatric Neuroengineering](https://www.dzirasalabs.com/)  analyzing electrical signals from mice brains to help the lab better understand mental health disorders.

My graduate degree is in statistics and undergraduate degree in applied math, both from BYU.

Outside of data science I love being outside in the mountains, playing and watching sports, reading books [(see here for recent reads)][1] and above all spending time with my family.

Feel free to contact me about anything related to data science at my email below.

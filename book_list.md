![QB](/images/qb.jpeg){: .image-left } Steve Young was a legend to me growing up. He played at BYU where both my parents went to school and did well in the NFL. Reading about his life was very interesting, but what was more interesting to me was getting a behind the scenes look at what being a quarterback in the NFL is like. Those guys (and all players) take a beating. Very eye opening.

![Lincoln](/images/lincoln.jpeg){: .image-left } This is written by my aunt (just kidding!) In all seriousness though, Doris Goodwin is an exceptional author and winner of the Pulitzer Prize as well. This was a really cool perspective on Lincoln by also focusing on the people around him. What stood out to me about Lincoln is his humor in the darkest times and his consistent humility. I think those attributes are the ones that have cemented his legacy.

![Adams](/images/adams.jpeg){: .image-left }

This book was a surprise for me as I had never really had an interest in learning about John Adams, but it hooked me from the moment I started it. It was fascinating to me to see the revolutionary war from an individual's perspective and find out that even the heroes of America were humans with weaknesses and insecurities too. Adams is not given enough credit and honour in our society today. Highly, highly recommend. It got a Pulitzer for a reason. <br/>

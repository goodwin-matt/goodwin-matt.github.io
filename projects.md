__**Bayesian Compressive Sensing**__
<br/>

I find Bayesian statistics and compressive sensing to both be very fascinating subjects and was fortunate enough to work on the intersection of these two areas for my masters thesis. The main goal of my research was to use Bayesian compressive sensing to characterize nonlinear chirp signals provided by Los Alamos National Laboratories. A byproduct of that work however was developing an R package using Rcpp and submitting it to CRAN. As of this writing the package is no longer on CRAN because of some issues with working on Solaris computers but I hope to get to it someday (I'll be honest - probably never unless someone contacts me about it). 

In the meantime the code works just fine and can be accessed on github [here](https://github.com/goodwin-matt/bcs). My thesis can be accessed [here][1] in pdf format.
 
Many thanks to my professor at the time Dr. Shane Reese, who is now the Dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU.

**Reinforcement learning in the game Halite using deep q-learning**

This was part of a hackathon I did at work with a colleague. We both wanted to learn more about reinforment learning and how to apply it to this online AI game called Halite that my colleague found (see [here](https://halite.io) for game). We found this great [blog](https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/) that implemented deep-q learning for the CartPole game and wanted to apply the [code](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning) to Halite.

**Bayesian Compressive Sensing**
<br/>

There is an old joke out there about putting a $20 bill in-between the pages of the library copy of your thesis with a note that reads "if you find this you can keep it". I thought about doing that somehow digitally here with my thesis and sending $20 bucks to anyone who stumbles on this page, but I felt like it wouldn't be the same since somebody might "google" their way here by accident.

In all seriosness though I find compressive sensing a very fascinating subject and was very fortunate to work on it during my masters program. The main goal of my research was to use Bayesian compressive sensing to characterize nonlinear chirp signals provided by Los Alamos National Laboratories. A by product of that work however was developing an R package using Rcpp and putting it on CRAN. As of this writing the package is no longer on CRAN because of some issues with working on Solaris computers but I hope to get to it someday. 

In the meantime the code can be accessed on github [here](https://github.com/goodwin-matt/bcs). My thesis can be accessed [here][1] in pdf format.
 
Many thanks to my professor at the time Dr. Shane Reese, who is now the Dean of the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU.
